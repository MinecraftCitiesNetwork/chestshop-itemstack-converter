# ChestShop ItemStack Converter

## Requirements
Requires you to have:
- A ChestShop database named items.db (found within `/plugins/ChestShop/`).
- A list of ChestShop item names (i.e. Crossbow#1bf) in a txt file named items.txt, each name must be seperated with a new line.
    - In DemocracyCraft you can find this from a Consumer Price Index (i.e. [Feburary 2025 CPI](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1X07clE0484zxwA5NvbXlfFx7XVTSAwjOXPvFsay5CRw), by copying all the item names from the first sheet.
    - Otherwise, these item names are typically found on ChestShop signs.
- Python 3+ installed on your machine.


## Usage
1. Place items.txt, items.db and converter.py in the same folder.
2. Run converter.py.
3. Open items.txt, you will now notice the names have been converted to be **human-readable!**

A sample items.db database and items.txt file have been included for you to test with. 

All contributions welcome.
